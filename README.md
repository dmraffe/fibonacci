# fibonacci
# use .net core to perform the exercise

# The first thing I did was generate an interface that handles the fibonaccio function, it was added as a service in the main part of the program.


# Create a controller called Fibonacci to receive the request. It waits for a numerical value. Validation is performed to receive a numerical value. If it is not numeric, a bad request is returned as a response.

# If everything goes well, we call the service that returns the requested Fibonacci number.

T# he improvement that I would make later would be to perform tests with larger numbers to check that everything is fine.
